    <h1>Programming Experience</h1>
    <article>
        <h2>My Journey from Zero Programming Experience to Learning HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>When I first started this course, I had zero experience with programming. Words like “HTML” and “CSS” felt foreign, mysterious, and maybe even a little intimidating. Diving into the world of web development from scratch can feel overwhelming, especially when everything you’re learning is new. But the journey has also been incredibly rewarding, filled with “aha!” moments that make every line of code worth it.</p>
        
        <h3>First Impressions: HTML - The Backbone of a Webpage</h3>
        <p>One of the first things I learned is that HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is like the skeleton of a webpage. It defines the structure and content. Starting with basic tags, I soon realized that HTML is surprisingly logical: you wrap different parts of content in tags that tell the browser what each part is supposed to represent. Headings, paragraphs, images, and lists—it all begins to take shape in simple yet powerful ways.</p>
        
        <p>The beauty of HTML lies in its simplicity. You can create an entire webpage with just a few lines of code. It might not look fancy, but it’s functional. This was a great confidence booster because, as a beginner, you get to see real results right away.</p>
        
        <h3>Adding Style with CSS: Transforming Pages from Plain to Beautiful</h3>
        <p>After learning how to structure a webpage, it was time to make it visually appealing with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). While HTML is about structure, CSS is all about style—colors, fonts, layouts, and even animations. It’s amazing how a little bit of CSS can completely change how a page looks and feels.</p>
        
        <p>At first, CSS was challenging. Understanding selectors, properties, and values took time, and positioning elements where I wanted them was not as straightforward as I had imagined. But once I got the hang of it, CSS became a creative outlet. It’s like painting but with code, and each property added made the page come to life.</p>
        
        <h3>Looking Forward: Building My Skills Step by Step</h3>
        <p>Now that I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, I’m excited to keep building on this foundation. I know that there’s still so much to learn, from JavaScript to back-end development, but this journey has taught me one important lesson: anyone can learn to code if they’re willing to put in the time and effort.</p>
        
        <p>Moving forward, I’m looking forward to creating more complex pages, experimenting with responsive design, and maybe even developing my first interactive web applications. Every step I take brings me closer to my goal, and with each new skill, I feel more empowered to create.</p>
